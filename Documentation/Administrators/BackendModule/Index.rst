Backend Module
==============

The hubspot extensions provides a backend module for administrators. You can find
it in the module menu at `Admin Tools > Hubspot Integration`.
The backend module contains two sub-modules: Forms and CTAs. Both work the same way:
They display which pages and content elements (non-deleted) currently contain
hubspot elements. You are able to switch to the content element itself or directly edit
the form in Hubspot. In order for it to work, you have to be logged into
Hubspot.
