Hubspot for Editors
===================

Hubspot provides you with many possibilities to create forms, which can be
integrated into your website. The integration of these forms usually happens
when a specific Javascript code snippet is added to your website. The
Hubspot extension simplifies this task. After the extension is successfully
installed and configurated, every TYPO3 editor is able to select exisiting
Hubspot forms and add them to the website. The forms are automatically
rendered by the Hubspot Javascript framework and added to the site.

Add Forms
---------

Adding forms is exactly like adding any other content element on a page. You
have to click on the "Create new content element" button and go to the
"Form elements" tab. Here you can select "Hubspot Form" and choose from a
list of all active Hubspot forms, which have previously been created in
Hubspot.

Overview of all forms
---------------------

In the module section you can find the module "Hubspot Integration". Here you
can get a simple overview of active forms and where they are currently in
use. You are able to switch to the content element itself or directly edit
the form in Hubspot. In order for it to work, you have to be logged into
Hubspot.

For this how to we are assuming that you are already comfortable working with
TYPO3 as an editor and know your way around the TYPO3 backend.
